# sysinfohtm
Bash to run as cron to grab system status and write to html.
Place in $path, run as cron job every minute or so. Grabs system status info, current openvpn clients, uptime, last 
dmesg logs, free disc space, running proccesses, ect. Then the status are written to an html/php page. Very handy for a 
VPS. Written specifically with openvpn servers in mind.
